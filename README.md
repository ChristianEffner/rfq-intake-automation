# rfq-intake-automation
This project is a private portfolio project to build a lightweight tool that converts unstructured RFQ inputs (e.g., email text and attachment text) into structured, validated data.   The tool extracts key RFQ fields (e.g., product/specification, quantity, requested delivery date, Incoterms) and outputs **JSON** following a defined schema.
